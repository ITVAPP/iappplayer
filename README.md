dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
```

#### 2. **Platform-Specific Configuration**

##### Android Configuration

Ensure minimum SDK version in `android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
android {
    namespace 'com.example.yourapp'
    compileSdkVersion 35
    
    defaultConfig {
        minSdkVersion 21  // Important: Minimum API 21

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

Ensure iOS version in `ios/Podfile`:

```ruby

```

## üíª Basic Usage

### üìå Import Package

Import IAppPlayer in your Dart file:

```dart
import 'package:iapp_player/iapp_player.dart';
```

### üé¨ Play Single Video

If you experience issues with audio or video playback, you can specify the preferred decoder type. (If not specified, hardware decoding is used by default.), To prioritize hardware decoding: preferredDecoderType: IAppPlayerDecoderType.hardwareFirst, To prioritize software decoding: preferredDecoderType: IAppPlayerDecoderType.softwareFirst

```dart
final player = IAppPlayerConfig.createPlayer(
  url: 'https://example.com/video.mp4',
  eventListener: (event) {
    print('Player event: ${event.iappPlayerEventType}');
  },
  // Optional parameter: Specify the preferred decoder type
  // IAppPlayerDecoderType.hardwareFirst - Hardware decoding priority (default)
  // IAppPlayerDecoderType.softwareFirst - Software decoding priority
  preferredDecoderType: IAppPlayerDecoderType.hardwareFirst,
);

_playerController = player.activeController;
```

### üéµ Playlist

You can use shuffleMode to set the playback mode for the playlist: true = shuffle playback ,  false = sequential playback , Set loopVideos to determine whether the entire playlist should loop.

```dart
final player = IAppPlayerConfig.createPlayer(
  urls: [
    'https://example.com/video1.mp4',
    'https://example.com/video2.mp4',
    'https://example.com/video3.mp4',
  ],
  eventListener: (event) {
    print('Player event: ${event.iappPlayerEventType}');
  },
  // Optional parameters: Set playback mode
  shuffleMode: false,  // true=shuffle playback, false=sequential playback (default)
  loopVideos: true,    // true=loop entire playlist (default), false=stop after playing all
);

_playerController = player.activeController;
```

### üé§ Music Player (with Lyrics)

LRC lyrics are supported. When playing audio, it is recommended to set audioOnly: true, which will display audio controls instead of video controls.

```dart
final musicPlayer = IAppPlayerConfig.createPlayer(
  urls: [
    'https://example.com/song1.mp3',
    'https://example.com/song2.mp3',
  ],
  titles: ['Song 1', 'Song 2'],
  subtitleContents: [  // LRC lyrics format
    '''[00:02.05]Wish to have someone's heart
[00:08.64]Lyrics: Hu Xiaojian Music: Luo Junlin
[00:27.48]The person who was in the small compartment of my backpack''',
    '''[00:00.00]About Love
[00:05.00]Beautiful melody
[00:10.00]Love is in the air''',
  ],
  eventListener: (event) {
    print('Music player event: ${event.iappPlayerEventType}');
  },
  // Optional parameter: Enable audio mode
  audioOnly: true,  // true=display audio controls, false=display video controls (default)
);

_playerController = musicPlayer.activeController;
```

### üßπ Resource Release

**Important**: To avoid memory leaks, you must properly release player resources when the page is destroyed. Here is the recommended release method:

```dart
Future<void> _releasePlayer() async {
    try {
      // 1. Clear player caches
      IAppPlayerConfig.clearAllCaches();
      if (_playerController != null) {
        try {
          // 2. Remove event listeners
          _playerController!.removeEventsListener(_videoListener);
          // 3. If playing, pause and mute first
          if (_playerController!.isPlaying() ?? false) {
            await _playerController!.pause();
            await _playerController!.setVolume(0);
          }
          // 4. Release player resources
          await Future.microtask(() {
            _playerController!.dispose(forceDispose: true);
          });
          _playerController = null;
        } catch (e) {
          print('Player cleanup failed: $e');
          _playerController = null;
        }
      }
    } catch (e) {
      print('Player cleanup failed: $e');
      _playerController = null;
    }
}

@override
void dispose() {
  _releasePlayer();
  super.dispose();
}
```
